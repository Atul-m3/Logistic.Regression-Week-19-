# Logistic Regression – Scratch vs Sklearn

## Overview
This project explores logistic regression from scratch using NumPy and compares it with sklearn’s implementation. It includes training, prediction, visualization, and performance analysis.

## Files
- `manual_logistic_regression.py`: Logistic regression built from scratch
- `sklearn_logistic_regression.py`: Sklearn implementation and comparison
- `visualization_analysis.py`: Decision boundaries, confusion matrices, and classification reports
- `visuals/`: Saved plots (sigmoid curve, decision boundaries)

## Reflection
Building the model manually helped me understand how gradient descent works and how predictions are formed. Sklearn is faster and optimized, but coding it myself made me think like an engineer, not just a tool user.

## Dataset
Simple binary classification using student exam scores and study hours.

## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
